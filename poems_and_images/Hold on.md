Cloaked in unknown,
heart-broke, alone,
in a world you feel
you've outgrown.

But I beg, keep dear 
those memories made
when warmth 
filled full
your home.

It may have passed,
their smile surpassed,
by the strong tide
of death.

Yet love 
struck once,
it can 
strike twice,

keep your heart
alive,
let time 
decide,

then I'll promise a love that will last.
