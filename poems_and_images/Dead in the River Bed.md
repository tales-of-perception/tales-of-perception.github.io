How did we dive on down the river bed,
When feet and hands were tied behind our head,
We drowned to death, lived only to forget,
On down the river bed, ten thousand secrets wept.

Secrets travelled a thousand miles apart,
River to sea, sea to skies, sky to stars,
A kiss of the Universe, life did arise,
With the power of stars, to blind unwise
Drunk eyes.

By aside the river edge, or atop the peddle bridge,
Hundred, twenty, hundred, twenty wept,
Plus one that turned and shone with pain thereof,
Ten thousand, hundred, twenty, plenty,
Tear drops.

How did we dive on down the river bed,
On down the river bed,
Ten thousand secrets wept.

(Note: wrote this whilst in Aarhus, Denmark, September 2024. Had a night out and met a girl there. We shared briefly some of the difficulties we'd gone through in life. Afterwards the ambulance were out by the river as apparently someone had jumped in. Many people were stood on a bridge, trying to gauge what was happening, and the girl (named Julie) kept saying she wanted to jump in to help, haha.)
