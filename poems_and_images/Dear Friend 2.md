Dear friend,

I stopped by your place earlier today but you weren't in, and none of my messages or calls seem to be getting through to you. So I'm dropping this note off instead. 

Your ex-girlfriend, of all people, messaged me to ask where you were. Layla, the girl from Canada. She seems worried. And now I am too. Have you two gotten back together or something? I thought you were now dating someone new? 

I don't want to judge, but maybe spending a good amount of time single could be what you need to clear your head and heart? Being single can be a real blast, just ask Mike and me!

Speaking of, me and Mike had a good round down at the golf course today. First time I managed to finish on par! It would have been great for you to have joined us. Next time eh, don't leave us hanging.

It's been too long, we're starting to miss you. 

Give us a call.

Love you pal.
