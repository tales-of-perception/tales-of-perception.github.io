I went to the flower store and saw
Amongst a stall of red roses
A bunch of pink tulips, that were decayed
And quite useless.

So I thought, no, tulips are not the ones for me,
And I grabbed a handful of roses, leaving somewhat happy.

A week passed by and my roses had died,
So I visited the flower store one more time,
But the roses were deprived of all of their life,
And the tulips, well they, had somehow survived.

So on second thought it seemed, as I gleaned at the pride
That the tulips did show in how they'd survived
That the tulips were mine, this I couldn't deny,
And I grabbed a handful of pink ones, and left
With a change of mind.
