I tend not to trust too much,

Life having left pains that linger
On, and on. Leaving this
Vacancy. I'm full of an
Emptiness caused by yearning.

Yearning for an innocence that once was,
Or a wisdom that could be.
Understand that it's not you, nor me – it's something ...

Surreal to the operations of love;
Of a heart so full it bleeds at its once torn seams.

Many attempts have been made, yet all?
Unsuccessful. So tell me – 
Can I count on you?
Hold me, until I feel it.
